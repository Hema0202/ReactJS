what is react?
React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook

React is a User Interface (UI) library

React is a tool for building UI components

What is npm & node 
Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting

NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages, or modules if you like.

www.npmjs.com hosts thousands of free packages to download and use.

The NPM program is installed on your computer when you install Node.js

ReactJS Architecture

React library is just UI library and it does not enforce any particular pattern to write a complex application. Developers are free to choose the design pattern of their choice. React community advocates certain design pattern. One of the patterns is Flux pattern. React library also provides lot of concepts like Higher Order component, Context, Render props, Refs etc., to write better code. React Hooks is evolving concept to do state management in big projects. Let us try to understand the high level architecture of a React application.

--React app starts with a single root component.

--Root component is build using one or more component.

--Each component can be nested with other component to any level.

--Composition is one of the core concepts of React library. So, each component is build by composing smaller components instead of inheriting one component from another component.

--Most of the components are user interface components.

--React app can include third party component for specific purpose such as routing, animation, state management, etc.

JSX

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX is basically a syntax extension of JavaScript.

React JSX helps us to write HTML in JavaScript and forms the basis of React Development. Using JSX is not compulsory but it is highly recommended for programming in React as it makes the development process easier as the code becomes easy to write and read. 

JSX creates an element in React that gets rendered in the UI. It is transformed into JavaScript functions by the compiler at runtime. Error handling and warnings become easier to handle when using JSX.

What is the use of React.createElement ?

React.createElement is a fundamental method of React JS. The main use of React.createElement is the Creation of a React component. It is the JavaScript format for creating react components. Also, the JSX react component when transpired invokes this only method for creating the component.


React.createElement(type,{props},children); 
// JSX code 
<type {props} >{children}</type


Parameters: React.createElement() takes three arguments. They are:

type: the type of the HTML element (h1,p, button, etc).
props: properties of the object({style:{size:10px}} or Eventhandlers, classNames,etc).
children: anything that needs to be enclosed by that component.

Styling	
sass 


NextJS is a React framework that is used to build full-stack web applications. It is used both for front-end as well and back-end. It simplifies React development with powerful features.

Next.js has built-in support for integrating with Sass after the package is installed using both the .scss and .sass extensions. You can use component-level Sass via CSS Modules and the .module.scss or .module.sass extension.

React Hooks

1.useState:-

The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.
State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.
